Try to understand them well by looking for some new vocabularies, including their antonym and synonym*The Shwedagon Pagoda, situated on Singuttara Hill in the center of Yangon (Rangoon), is the most sacred Buddhist stupa in Myanmar and one of the most important religious reliquary monuments in the world and also one of famous tourist attractions. The proposed property includes the hill atop of which the main stupa is located, the hill top reliquary stupa and associated religious buildings and sacred statuary, bells, and other emblems situated on the hill, as well as the hill's surrounding sacred perimeter. The proposed property comprises a total area of 46.3 hectares. The stupa's plinth is made of bricks covered with genuine gold plates and the main stupa itself is entirely covered in gold, adorned with a crowning umbrella encrusted with diamonds and other jewels. Following a tradition began in the 15th century by the Queen Shin Sawbu (BinnyaThau), who donated her weight in gold to the pagoda, Buddhist devotees from all walks of life and all regions of Buddhist Asia, as well as monarchs throughout Burma's history, have donated gold to the Shwedagon in order to maintain the monument, and in so-doing gain merit, in this life and future lives. There are four covered monumental stairways leading from the four cardinal directions from the base of Singuttara Hill up to the main stupa. On the ascent to the main stupa, these stairways give access to three intermediary terraces, or platforms (pisssaya).On these platforms are located circumambulatory walkways around the hill punctuated with Buddhist monasteries and community lecture-cum-prayer halls (dhammayons). The main golden iconic reliquary stupa is located on the fourth, uppermost terrace/platform, surrounded by numerous pavilions and shrines, large bronze bells, and other decorative features related to Hindu-Buddhist iconography. The spatial siting of the attributes within the site is organized following a system derived from Hindu cosmology, indicated by cosmic pillars surrounding the central main reliquary stupa, which mark the planetary positions within the zodiac. The design of the site is an intentional recreation of the Hindu-Buddhist cosmos, reflected on earth.This is Istanbul's top attraction; the Church of the Holy Wisdom (Hagia Sophia) began as a Byzantine church, then it became a mosque during the Ottoman Era and today is a museum. It is without doubt a great architectural wonder. The original structure has not survived but it was constructed here in the 4th century under the founder of Constantinople, Constantine the Great. After the original building was destroyed Constantine's son Emperor Theodosius had a new church built in its place. The second structure burnt down in 532 but parts of it have been recovered through excavations. The structure we see today dates back to 532-537 when its construction was over seen by Justinian I. Although the church suffered from earthquakes and an attack by the Crusaders in 1204 It has retained its historic structure and decoration. From 1453 for 500 years the church became the main mosque of Istanbul during the Ottoman Era.The church was designed by Anthemius of Tralles and Isidore of Miletus; it has a classic basilica layout. The church features rich mosaics and a grand central dome with a diameter of 31 meters. The circular dome rests on a rectangular base all richly decorated with murals, Arabic calligraphy and mosaics. All the interior surfaces are polychrome marble in green, purple and white with gold mosaics. You can see the marble mihrab which has survived from the Ottoman Era. Of the many magnificent mosaics the most famous are on the upper floor galleries. From the galleries you have a wonderful view down to the nave. Outside in the church grounds there are several points of interest including mausoleums, a baptistery and some excavated remains.Bella : Have you thought about what you might like to do this weekend, Cita? Cita : I haven't given it much thought. Do you have any ideas?Bella : I was thinking of maybe going to the beach would be great. Cita : That sounds like a great idea! The weather has been great for the beach.Bella : Would you be interested in joining me? We can have fun together.Cita : Sure, I would love to to go with you there. So when would we be leaving? Bella : I thought that we could leave around 7:30 on Saturday morning. Cita : Yeah, that would give us plenty time to explore the beach feel the gentle breeze and the white sand beneath my feet. I also heard that this weekend there will be a kite festival on the Padang Garang beach in Sanur.Bella : I hope we are able to see the festival.Cita : By the way, thank you for inviting me to go to the beach with you. I'm really looking forward to Saturday. Bella : It's all right. See you on Saturday morning.Cita : See you too.​</a>

Try to understand them well by looking for some new vocabularies, including their antonym and synonym*The Shwedagon Pagoda, situated on Singuttara Hill in the center of Yangon (Rangoon), is the most sacred Buddhist stupa in Myanmar and one of the most important religious reliquary monuments in the world and also one of famous tourist attractions. The proposed property includes the hill atop of which the main stupa is located, the hill top reliquary stupa and associated religious buildings and sacred statuary, bells, and other emblems situated on the hill, as well as the hill's surrounding sacred perimeter. The proposed property comprises a total area of 46.3 hectares. The stupa's plinth is made of bricks covered with genuine gold plates and the main stupa itself is entirely covered in gold, adorned with a crowning umbrella encrusted with diamonds and other jewels. Following a tradition began in the 15th century by the Queen Shin Sawbu (BinnyaThau), who donated her weight in gold to the pagoda, Buddhist devotees from all walks of life and all regions of Buddhist Asia, as well as monarchs throughout Burma's history, have donated gold to the Shwedagon in order to maintain the monument, and in so-doing gain merit, in this life and future lives. There are four covered monumental stairways leading from the four cardinal directions from the base of Singuttara Hill up to the main stupa. On the ascent to the main stupa, these stairways give access to three intermediary terraces, or platforms (pisssaya).On these platforms are located circumambulatory walkways around the hill punctuated with Buddhist monasteries and community lecture-cum-prayer halls (dhammayons). The main golden iconic reliquary stupa is located on the fourth, uppermost terrace/platform, surrounded by numerous pavilions and shrines, large bronze bells, and other decorative features related to Hindu-Buddhist iconography. The spatial siting of the attributes within the site is organized following a system derived from Hindu cosmology, indicated by cosmic pillars surrounding the central main reliquary stupa, which mark the planetary positions within the zodiac. The design of the site is an intentional recreation of the Hindu-Buddhist cosmos, reflected on earth.This is Istanbul's top attraction; the Church of the Holy Wisdom (Hagia Sophia) began as a Byzantine church, then it became a mosque during the Ottoman Era and today is a museum. It is without doubt a great architectural wonder. The original structure has not survived but it was constructed here in the 4th century under the founder of Constantinople, Constantine the Great. After the original building was destroyed Constantine's son Emperor Theodosius had a new church built in its place. The second structure burnt down in 532 but parts of it have been recovered through excavations. The structure we see today dates back to 532-537 when its construction was over seen by Justinian I. Although the church suffered from earthquakes and an attack by the Crusaders in 1204 It has retained its historic structure and decoration. From 1453 for 500 years the church became the main mosque of Istanbul during the Ottoman Era.The church was designed by Anthemius of Tralles and Isidore of Miletus; it has a classic basilica layout. The church features rich mosaics and a grand central dome with a diameter of 31 meters. The circular dome rests on a rectangular base all richly decorated with murals, Arabic calligraphy and mosaics. All the interior surfaces are polychrome marble in green, purple and white with gold mosaics. You can see the marble mihrab which has survived from the Ottoman Era. Of the many magnificent mosaics the most famous are on the upper floor galleries. From the galleries you have a wonderful view down to the nave. Outside in the church grounds there are several points of interest including mausoleums, a baptistery and some excavated remains.Bella : Have you thought about what you might like to do this weekend, Cita? Cita : I haven't given it much thought. Do you have any ideas?Bella : I was thinking of maybe going to the beach would be great. Cita : That sounds like a great idea!
